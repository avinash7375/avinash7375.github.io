    <p>So, there’s a reason why I’m on compilers - coz I’ve to learn every possible thing about programming and Data Structure.</p>
    
    <p class="font-semibold">— The only main data structure used in <strong>Compilers</strong> is Tree and Graph Data structures - that works for memory mapping.</p>
    
    <p>—— This is the main idea of going through Compilers.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">First, we’ll see what is Compilers</h2>
    
    <p>Compiler is a concept that does the parsing of a defined semantic structure with its syntactic structure.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
      <li>Learn Lexical Analyzer.</li>
      <li>Then Parser</li>
      <li>Then Semantic Analyzer</li>
      <li>Then Syntactic Analyzer</li>
      <li>Then Intermediate code Generation</li>
      <li>Then Optimizer</li>
      <li>Then Code Generation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This whole flow gives us the areas of research on creating a compiler from scratch.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">Then, we’ll learn about DSA.</h2>

    <p>Then, we’ll try to see why we need DSA for compilers.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>From here it’s all about DSA and why we need it in Compilers.</p>
    
    <p>The aim is to learn all DSA techniques till Trees and Graphs — which will help in solving problems of memory management and garbage collection.</p>

    <p>In Data Structure — we will include Object Oriented Programming concepts.</p>

    <p><strong>Graph → Trees → Heaps → Hash Tables.</strong></p>

      An Apology to myself: Today i.e., 07th October, 2024, I’ve done some mistakes that are not to be tolerated by myself, and I need myself to look on it as a serious thing that will lead to my future personal growth.

    <p>I’m writing this so I won’t make this mistake happen again.</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-1">
      <li>I spent more than my earning on coffee that led to scarcity of money at the right time.</li>
      <li>I cheated myself by taking practical codes for students from ChatGPT, which affects my character of integrity.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">NOW WHAT SHOULD I DO?</h3>

    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-1">
      <li>I should learn all the basic concepts of Compiler Design in depth to make it my career for the rest of my research life.</li>
      <li>I should be strong on my basics — <strong>Programming language (C/C++), Theory Of Computation, Software Engineering, Compiler Design basics</strong>.</li>
      <li>I should challenge myself daily on the above context.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We will get into the development with MLIR, a compiler creation tool, made under the LLVM project at Google by Chris Lattner.</p>

    <p>After a certain period of time, I got some of my timeout to restart my blogging on my concepts i.e., <strong>Compilers, Programming Languages, and Computer Architecture - Security and Performance.</strong></p>

    <p><em>But due to certain delays in my research I’m forgetting some of the things and I am continuing to start it again — with a different motivation and topic.</em></p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Getting Started with MLIR</h3>

    <p>Let’s begin with a concept called MLIR structure and its passes.</p>
