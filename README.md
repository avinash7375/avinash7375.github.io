So, there’s a reason why I’m on compilers - coz I’ve to learn every possible thing about programming and Data Structure.
— The only main data structure used in **Compilers** is Tree and Graph Data structures - that works for memory mapping.
—— This is the main idea of going through Compilers.

- First, we’ll see what is Compilers
    
    Compiler is a concept that does the parsing of a defined semantic structure with it’s syntactic structure.
    
    learn Lexical Analyzer.
    Then Parser
    Then Semantic Analyzer
    Then Syntactic Analyzer
    Then Intermediate code Generation
    Then Optimizer
    Then Code Generation.
    
    These whole above content, gives us the areas of research on creating a compiler from scratch.
    

Then, we’ll learn about DSA.

Then, we’ll try to see why we need DSA for compilers.

---

From here it’s all about DSA and why we need it in Compilers.
The aim is to learn all DSA techniques till Trees and Graph - Which will help me in solving problems of memory management and garbage collection.

In Data Structure - we will include Object Oriented Programming concepts.

Graph —> Trees —> Heaps —> Hash Tables.

PARSING ALGORITHMS:

An Apology to myself:- Today i.e., 07th October, 2024, I’ve done some mistake that are not to be tolerated by myself, and I need myself to look on it as a serious thing that will lead o my future personal growth.

I’m writing this so I won’t make this mistake happen again.

1. I spent more than my earning on coffee that leads to scarcity of money at right time.
2. I cheat myself by taking practical codes for students from chatgpt, that defects my character of cheating.

NOW WHAT SHOULD I DO?

1. I should learn all the basic concepts of Compiler Design from depth to make it my career for the rest of my research life.
2. I should be strong on my basics - [Programming language- C/C++, Theory Of Computation, Software Engineering approaches, Compiler Design basics]
3. I should rack myself daily on the context above.

[Here’s something about MLIR](https://www.notion.so/Here-s-something-about-MLIR-211a1fa0d1de80f2b250f698c04aa890?pvs=21)

We will get into the development with MLIR, a compiler creation tool, made under the project LLVM at google by Chris Lattner.

After a certain period of time I got some of my timeout to restart my blogging on my concepts i.e.,  **Compilers, programming languages and computer Architecture - Security and Performance.**

**But due to certain delay in my research I’m getting to forgot some of the things and I am still continuing to start it again where I left, but with a different motivation and different topic to do.**

So, getting started with it, with a concept called MLIR structure and it’s passes.

Above is the document I will be using for this further things.
